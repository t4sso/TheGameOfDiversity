//: Plants and animals depend on each other and on their physical environments to keep our entire system alive and well. The living web is held together not by nails or glue, but by interdependence â€” one strand stays in place because it is linked with many others.

//: Biodiversity refers to the variety of living things, just like in a forest where you see trees, plants, deer, spiders, birds, etc. Biodiversity is important because it helps prevent any one gene, species, or ecosystem from throwing nature out of balance.
