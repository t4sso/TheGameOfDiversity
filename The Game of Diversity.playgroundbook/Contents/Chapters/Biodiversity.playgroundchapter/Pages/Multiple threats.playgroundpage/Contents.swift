 Sometimes a disease might spread _because_ of starvation, loss of habitat, and/or lack of genetic diversity. Having a large variety of genes helps protect the populations against environmental changes, both natural and manmade. Mankind has unfortunately caused the extinction of many species.

 **A few examples:**
 + _Northern white rhino_ in March 2018 and _West African black rhino_ in 2011
 + _Pyrenean ibex_ (a wild goat from the mountains between Spain and France) in 2000
 + _Javan tiger_ (one of three tiger species unique to the Sunda islands) in 1976
 + _Caribbean monk seal_ in the 1950s
 + _Tasmanian tiger_ in 1936
 + _North American sea mink_ in the late 1800â€™s
 + _African cheetahs_ and _koalas_ both suffer from a lack of genetic diversity and are at risk of extinction today.
